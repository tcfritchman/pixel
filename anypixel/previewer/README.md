### In The Browser

- The page will automatically refresh when the entry file is changed.

- The **Pointer** button is the default input mode: one cursor, one button input at a time.

- The **Hand** button simulates a flat hand pushing against the wall. The shape of the hand is 
randomly generated in a 5x5 grid, and the timing of the inputs is fuzzed to simulate the variations 
of human behavior.

- The **Eye** button toggles an overlay which displays the button events as black squares.
